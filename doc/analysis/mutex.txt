Name : Mutex 
Input : list of .c files : "Multithreaded program or Linux kernel driver."
Info : "Try to prove that in a multithreaded program all non-local memory accesses are protected by pthread locks/semaphores/kernel locks."
Preprocessing : no /* maybe later */
Interval Domain : no
Context Sensitive : default yes 
Path Sensitive : default yes
Options : 
  --earlyglobs :  Side-effecting of globals right after initialization.
  --write-races : Ignores read accesses altogether in reporting races.
  --failing-locks :  Takes the possible failing of locking operations into account.
Result : format string for errors ; 
      "Datarace over <var>:
      write in some thread with lockset: <lockset_a> (<path_a>:<line_a>)
      write in some thread with lockset: <lockset_b> (<path_b>:<line_b>)" 
      means, that <var> is neither protected by a lock.

      "Transactionality violation in function <fun>:
      variable <var> has offensive priority <m>
      versus a defensive overall priority of <n>"
      means, that during the execution of <fun> <var> may be accessed elsewhere.

      format string for warnings ; 
      
      format string for misc results ; 
      "Found correlation: <var> is guarded by lockset <lockset>" 
      means, that whenever <var> is accessed ALL resources in <lockset> are held. 
      
      "Found correlation: <var_pattern> is guarded by lockset <lock_pattern>" 
      means, that whenever an access matches <var_pattern> then a lock with <lock_pattern> is taken.

Solver : all

 solvers: 
  demand driven (effectWCon) ; cannot solve interval domains "Global invariants for analyzing multithreaded applications" Seidl/Vene/MÃ¼ller-Olm
  round robin (solverConSideRR) ; cannot solve interval domains 
  round robin with widening and narrowing (solverConSideWNRR) ; can solve interval domains
 
 (If "interval domain" is selected in options somewhere then use round robin with widening and narrowing.)
