(** A simple worklist equation solver *)

module Make (Var: Hashtbl.HashedType) (Dom: Lattice.S) :
sig
  module HT : Hashtbl.S with type key = Var.t
  type 'a table    = 'a HT.t
  (** A hashtable mapping system variables to ['a] *)

  (** A few type synonyms to make it more readable: *)

  type variable    = Var.t
  (** The variables of constraint system *)
  type domain      = Dom.t
  (** The value domain of the variables *)

  type assignment  = variable -> domain
  (** Assignments from variables to their values *)

  (** Right hand sides of an equation in functional form. The rhs is a function
    * that given the current values of the variables will evaluate the
    * expression on the rhs. *)
  type lhs         = variable 
  (** The lhs of each equation is just a system variable *)
  type system     = lhs -> rhs
  (** A system of equations is just a mapping from each lhs to the corresponding
    * rhs *)
  type solution    = assignment'
  (** The solution to a system of constraints is an an assignment of variables
    * satisfying all constraints. We prefer a the data-structure representation
    * of the solution as a hashtable rather than an abstract mapping. *)

  (** And finally... *)

  val solve: system -> variable list -> solution
  (** [solve system xs] solves a [system] of equations in a demand-driven
    * fashion starting from the variables [xs] *)
